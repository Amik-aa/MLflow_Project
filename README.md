# This README file provides detailed steps for setting up and understanding the project structure. 
# 1. YAML-styled Configuration File
The MLflow file serves as a central configuration file for the project. It contains the following information:
Project Name: This is the human-readable name of the project, helping users identify the purpose of the project easily.

Environment File Name: Specifies the name of the YAML file that describes the project's environment. 
Keeping this information in the configuration file ensures easy modification if the environment file name needs to be changed in the future.

List of Entry Points: Lists the primary entry points or main files that initiate different functionalities in the project. 
This allows for easy navigation and understanding of the project's structure.

Purpose: The YAML-styled configuration file consolidates important project-specific information in a single file, 
making it easier to manage and modify without diving into code. It promotes consistency and reduces the likelihood of errors when multiple components depend on shared information.
# 2. Environment Description File
The conda_env.yaml file provides detailed information about the project's environment, including:
Python Version: Specifies the version of Python required for the project.
Dependencies: Lists all the external libraries and packages required for the project to run successfully. Including this information in a structured YAML file simplifies the process of installing dependencies.

Purpose: Separating environment details into a dedicated file enhances the project's reproducibility. 

# 3.Main.py file
The main.py file serves as the central script that ties together different components of the project. It performs the following tasks:
Reads Configuration: Reads the project configuration from the MLflow file. This step ensures that the project is aware of its environment and entry points.
Loads Environment: Uses the information from the conda_env.yaml file to set up the required Python version and install necessary dependencies. This step ensures that the project runs in a controlled and reproducible environment.
Entry Points Execution: Initiates the main functionalities of the project based on the list of entry points specified in the configuration file. This step is crucial for executing the core functionalities seamlessly.

Purpose: The main Python file acts as a coordinator, ensuring that the project is correctly configured and the environment is set up before executing the main functionalities.
This separation of concerns enhances modularity and maintainability, making it easier to extend or modify the project in the future.

# 4. The separation of configuration, environment, and main functionality ensures that the project remains well-organized and easily understandable.
